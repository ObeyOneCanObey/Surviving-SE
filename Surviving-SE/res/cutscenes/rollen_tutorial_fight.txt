There are monsters and bosses you will have to
fight. In a fight, you can choose to attack or
use a potion. If you attack, you can select a
weapon to attack with. Each weapon has special
traits that make it suitable for different types
of fights. Heal up with a potion if your GPA gets
too low. Itâ€™s on you to decide what the best
course of action is.
